    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Ratatouille is a classic French Provençal stew that captures the essence of summer by simmering eggplant,
        zucchini, bell peppers, and tomatoes into a <b>velvety, aromatic medley</b>. Traditionally seasoned with garlic,
        onions, and herbes de Provence, the dish is prized for its depth of flavor and rustic, melt-in-your-mouth
        texture. It’s a soulful celebration of garden produce, where the sweetness of caramelized peppers balances the
        savory richness of olive oil and the bright acidity of the tomatoes.</p>

    <p>While often served as a chunky, home-style stew, it can also be prepared as a <b>Confit Byaldi,</b> featuring
        thin, uniform slices of vegetables layered in an elegant spiral and slow-roasted to perfection. Regardless of
        the presentation, a great Ratatouille relies on high-quality olive oil and patience, allowing each vegetable to
        soften until the flavors meld into a harmonious, comforting dish. It is a versatile staple that is equally
        delicious served hot as a main course or cold on a piece of crusty bread the following day.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Eggplant (Aubergine):</b> 1 large or 2 medium; look for firm, shiny skin.</li>
        <li><b>Zucchini</b>2 medium; green or yellow (or a mix for color).</li>
        <li><b>Bell Peppers</b>2 large; red and yellow are preferred for their sweetness.</li>
        <li><b>Tomatoes</b>4-5 large, ripe tomatoes (like Roma or Vine-ripened) or one 14oz can of high-quality crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><b>Onions & Garlic</b>1 large yellow or white onion.3-4 cloves, minced (don't be shy here!).</li>
        <li><b>Texture:</b>Velvety and tender. The vegetables should be soft enough to melt in your mouth but not so
            overcooked that they turn into a colorless mush.</li>
        <li><b>Aroma:</b>Fragrant with Herbes de Provence—typically a blend of thyme, rosemary, oregano, and sometimes
            lavender or marjoram.</li>
        <li><b>Taste:</b>A balance of savory umami from the eggplant, natural sweetness from caramelized peppers, and a
            bright tang from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><b>Extra Virgin Olive Oil:</b>Used generously for sautéing and finishing.</li>
        <li><b>Herbes de Provence:</b>A blend of dried thyme, rosemary, oregano, and savory. (Fresh thyme and basil are also excellent additions).</li>
        <li><b>Tomato Paste:</b>1 tablespoon to deepen the color and base flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Salt & Black Pepper:</b>To Taste.</li>
        <li><b>Fresh Basil:</b>A handful of torn leaves for a bright garnish at the end.</li>
    </ul>
